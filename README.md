This minetest mod expands the basic set of farming-related
crops that minetest_game offers. A list of crops/crafts is
below.

1. Melons

Melon plants grow from melon seeds. Once a plant is mature (there
are 5 stages) it will spawn a melon block adjacent to the plant.
The melon block can be harvested by punching, and yields 3-5
melon slices. The melon slice can be crafted to a melon seed.

2. Corn.

Corn plants are 2 blocks high, and yield corn cobs. These can be
cooked to corn-on-the-cob, or processed to make corn seed (corn
kernels, basically).

Digging a mature plant yields the corn cob. A harvested corn plant
"wilts", and needs to be dug away to make the land usable, or can
be left as ornamental 2-block plant. Digging either top or bottom
block works in all cases.

3. Tomatoes.

Tomatoes appear to work simple enough, until you harvest them
the first time: The plant stays! However, after the 3rd to 5th
harvest, the plant wilts and needs to be removed, since no more
tomatoes will grow on the plant. Per harvest you can get 1-2
tomatoes only. You can craft the tomatoes to tomato seeds, as
expected.
