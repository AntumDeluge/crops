This minetest mod expands the basic set of farming-related
crops that minetest_game offers. A list of crops/crafts is
below.

1. Melons

Melon plants grow from melon seeds. Once a plant is mature (there
are 5 stages) it will spawn a melon block adjacent to the plant.
The melon block can be harvested by punching, and yields 3-5
melon slices. The melon slice can be crafted to a melon seed.

2. Corn.

Corn plants are 2 blocks high, and yield corn cobs. These can be
cooked to corn-on-the-cob, or processed to make corn seed (corn
kernels, basically).

Digging a mature plant yields the corn cob. A harvested corn plant
"wilts", and needs to be dug away to make the land usable, or can
be left as ornamental 2-block plant. Digging either top or bottom
block works in all cases.
